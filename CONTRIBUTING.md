# Contributing

Thanks for your help! Due to BuckleScript's nature, the contribution setup isn't all straightforward (though well documented). If something isn't working, please file an issue or ping us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml)!

## Setup

Prerequisites:

- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/), the OCaml package manager (v2)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Make
- [Go](https://golang.org) to run tests
- OS: Mac/Linux (BuckleScript works on Windows, but developing the repo in Windows isn't tested. Contribution welcome!)

```
# Use the correct opam switch for working on BuckleScript
opam update
opam switch create 4.02.3+buckle-master
eval `opam config env`
opam switch reinstall 4.02.3+buckle-master # do this if you get errors even from a clean compilation
ocaml -version # confirm you're using 4.02.3
opam install camlp4 cppo

# Install dev-time npm dependencies
npm install

# Build BuckleScript's forked OCaml
cd vendor/ocaml
./configure -prefix `pwd`
make world.opt
make install

# Build BuckleScript itself
cd ../../
make
make install

# install this local bs globally
npm -g install .
```

## Test on a Dummy Project

Go somewhere else and do this:

```
bsb -init foo -theme basic-reason
cd foo
npm run build
```

And whenever you modify a file in bucklescript, run this inside `jscomp/`:

```
make ../lib/bsc.exe && ./install-bsc.sh # build the compiler and make it available globally
make ../lib/bsb.exe && ./install-bsb.sh # build the build system and make it available globally
```

This will substitute the global `bsc.exe` & `bsb.exe` you just installed with the newly built one. Then run `npm run build` again in the dummy project and see the changes! The iteration cycle for testing these should be around 2 seconds =).

## Troubleshooting

Did any of the above step not work?

- If you get compilation errors even from a supposedly clean compilation, you might have skipped the opam reinstall step above: `opam switch reinstall 4.02.3+buckle-master`
- Make sure you did ``eval `opam config env` `` in your CLI/bashrc/zshrc
- **If the vendored ocaml changed between when you last iterated on the repo and now**, you probably skipped the `opam switch reinstall 4.02.3+buckle-master` part. You'll have to do `git clean -xdf` and then restart with the build instructions. Careful, as `git clean` removes your uncommitted changes.
- **If these fail too**, make sure you do have the correct `ocamlopt` in your environment: `which ocamlopt` should show an `opam` path, not `reason-cli` path. If you see the latter, this means it overrode the global `ocamlopt` BuckleScript needed. In this case, either temporarily uninstall reason-cli or make sure your opam PATH overrides the reason-cli PATH (and not the other way around) in your bashrc/zshrc.

Whenever there are dependencies changes: do `make depend` in the specific directory, when available. This allows the makefile to track new dependencies.

## Change the Vendored OCaml Compiler

This section is reserved for when you're making a change to the vendored ocaml compiler itself, in `vendor/ocaml`, and then testing on super-errors changes at the same time. If you're doing this for whatever reason, then the previous quick iteration workflow wouldn't work. Here's what you have to do after each change:

```
# at project root
cd jscomp
make force-snapshotml # make sure your changes are reflected in jscomp/bin/whole_compiler.ml
make -C ../lib bsc.exe && ./install-bsc.sh
make -C ../lib bsb.exe && ./install-bsb.sh
```

## Contributing to the runtime

BuckleScript runtime implementation is currently a mix of OCaml and JavaScript. (`jscomp/runtime` directory). The JavaScript code is defined in the `.ml` file using the `bs.raw` syntax extension.

The goal is to implement the runtime **purely in OCaml** and you can help!

Each new PR should include appropriate testing.

Currently all tests are in `jscomp/test` directory and you should either add/modify a test file which covers the part of the compiler you modified.

- Add the filename in `jscomp/test/test.mllib`
- Add a test suite. The specification is in `jscomp/test/mt.ml`. For example some simple tests would be like:
  ```ocaml
  let suites : _ Mt.pair_suites =
     ["hey", (fun _ -> Eq(true, 3 > 2));
         "hi", (fun _ -> Neq(2,3));
         "hello", (fun _ -> Approx(3.0, 3.0));
         "throw", (fun _ -> ThrowAny(fun _ -> raise 3))
         ]
  let () = Mt.from_pair_suites __FILE__ suites
  ```

- Run the tests:
  `mocha -R list jscomp/test/your_test_file.js`
  To build libs, tests and run all tests:
  `make libs && make -C jscomp/test all && npm test`

- See the coverage: `npm run cover`

## Contributing to Documentation

See https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript.github.io

## Contributing to the API Reference

The API reference is generated from doc comments in the source code.
[Here](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript/blob/99650/jscomp/others/js_re.mli#L146-L161)'s a good example

Some tips and guidelines:

- The first sentence or line should be a very short summary. This is used in indexes and by tools like merlin.
- Ideally, every function should have **at least one** `@example`.
- Cross-reference another definition with `{! identifier}`. But use them sparingly, they’re a bit verbose (currently, at least).
- Wrap non-cross-referenced identifiers and other code in `[ ... ]`.
- Escape `{`, `}`, `[`, `]` and `@` using `\`.
- It’s possible to use `{%html ...}` to generate custom html, but use this very, very sparingly.
- A number of "documentation tags" are provided that would be nice to use, but unfortunately they’re often not supported for \`external\`s. Which is of course most of the API.
- `@param` usually doesn’t work. Use `{b <param>} ...` instead
- `@returns` usually doesn’t work. Use `{b returns} ...` instead.
- Always use `@deprecated` when applicable.
- Always use `@raise` when applicable.
- Always provide a `@see` tag pointing to MDN for more information when available.

See [Ocamldoc documentation](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/ocamldoc.html#sec333) for more details.

To generate the html, run `make docs` in `jscomp/`.

Html generation uses a custom generator located in `odoc_gen/` and
custom styles located in `docs/api_static`.

## Make a Release

In release mode, assuming you have NodeJS and OCaml compiler with the right version installed:

```sh
node scripts/install.js
```

The build process will generate configure file with correct `LIBDIR` path,
build all binaries and libraries and
install the binaries into `bin` and lib files into `lib`.

First it will try to generate `bin/config_whole_compiler.ml` based on existing
OCaml installation, if it fails, it will try to invoke `buildocaml.sh` to
install an OCaml compiler from scratch, and retry again.

### Publish Process

- Run `make force-snapshotml`
- Bump the compiler version

## Code structure

The highlevel architecture is illustrated as below:

```
Lambda IR (OCaml compiler libs) ---+
  |   ^                            |
  |   |                     Lambda Passes (lam_* files)
  |   |             Optimization/inlining/dead code elimination
  |   \                            |
  |    \ --------------------------+
  |
  |  Self tail call elimination
  |  Constant folding + propagation
  V
JS IR (J.ml)  ---------------------+
  |   ^                            |
  |   |                     JS Passes (js_* files)
  |   |            Optimization/inlining/dead code elimination
  |   \                            |
  |    \  -------------------------+
  |
  |  Smart printer includes scope analysis
  |
  V
Javascript Code
```

Note that there is one design goal to keep in mind, never introduce
any meaningless symbol unless real necessary, we do optimizations,
however, it should also compile readable output code.

## Contribution Licensing

other major open source projects.

To participate under these terms, all that you must do is include a line like the following as the
last line of the commit message for each commit in your contribution:
